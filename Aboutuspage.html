            <h1>Hello, My name is Nick Berkshire-Lilley</h1>
        </div>
            <div class="showtell">To give you a better understanding of my skills, It would be best to talk about what I have
            done so far to progress in my career.</div>
            <div class="aboutus">My career started like most people when I had left secondary school, in 2021, I started my first year
            at <b>Northampton College</b>here I studied<b>Multimedia Journalism at Level 3</b> and left College with a <b>distinction from my Final Major Project</b>
                <div><img id="collegelogo" src="NorthamptonCollegeLogo.jpeg" alt="Northampton College Logo">
                    <img id="collegegrouppic" src="CollegeGrouppic.jpg" alt="Picture of me and my college class on the last day of college"></div>
            During my time at College, I produced various different project surrounding practices used in Journalism in the 21st century, these can be found under my 
            <a href="ProjectPage.html" style="text-decoration: none;">Project page</a>. along with these projects, I had also gotten myself into a creative and expressive hobby, this being <i>photography</i>, 
            this is something that has been swept under the rug when I began to change into computing but is still a hobby that I put alot of time and practice into when I find something that catches my eye.
            moving into another major part of my college progression, in my first year of college, a local Radio Station was offering young people from nearby schools and colleges
            the chance to get some work experience with radio, sadly due to busy scheduling and other time related issues, I could not further my experience with NLive but whilst
            at the time I was working towards going into the <b>Media Industry</b>
                <div><img id="NliveLogo" src="NLIVEradiologo.png" alt="NliveradiostationLogo"></div>
            this is still something that had been a great asset for development. after I had finish college with my qualifications, I had for a short while went to<b>Oxford Brookes University</b>, sadly, this did not work out for me so I returned home
            to get some work experience in a local supermarket near my home whilst looking at how i could progress my career, the issue for me lied in a lack of interest in the Media Industry
            I felt as if I had seen all there was to see, did all there was to do at a basic level and felt that I needed a step up. this is when I had decided to move into Computing. 
            Computing was a topic that had always interested me but I always played it safe and stuck to the confinement of my Comfort Zone and thats when I decided to reinrole for University
            just more locally and aspiring to get a degree in something that would challenge me more, this is how I ended up choosing<b>Softwaring Engineering</b>,there have been many challenges
            <h3>Looking towards the future is where my Priorities are now </h3>however, My ambitions have led to me to create some amazing products this website included but with each
            week, I look for ways to challenge myself and even put myself out there, Currently, I am working on a business negotiation with a startup company that specialises in clothing for Transmen
            this is something that I myself as a Transman am looking forward to helping with.
            this will be something that will allow me to take my skills further and get to grips with working world of web development as well as allow me to look towards building my
            portfolio up even more.
            <h4>Thank you for hearing my story and I hope that I have given you an insight into my journey so far and hope you will stick around to watch my career in computing
            take off further</h4>
