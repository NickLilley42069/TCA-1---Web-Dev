<div class="report">
this is the research and experimenting that I had conducted, at the end of this, there is also my Harvard Referencing section.
I started off with looking at web developers websites that they had made to see what elements I liked and what I could implement into my website as well as getting an understanding of what this could potentially look like for me.
Here are four of my potential candidates, these have been picked based just off on aesthetics.

Seb Kay.

    <tr>
        <td>Has a section for his code on the main page (this shows a piece of the code as well as what languages they utilised)</td>
        <td>The app section is just a complete mirror image copy of the website, which works for this but not for what I want to make.</td>

            the contact page is simple yet easy to use, utilising a * which would indicate that every column needs to be filled in. (the subject part is a nice touch)

        <td></td>
        <td>In the app variation it keeps his name (which sends you to the top of the page) and the about/work element, these are always there but not in a nicely created way, this makes it look unkept</td>

        <td>I don’t like how sophisticated it is, it does have its perks and for itself is a nice website, but that element is not something I want to follow up with.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Uses arrows to move between the pages.</td>
        <td>No colour used and whilst it works for this website, it is not something I want to skip out on.</td>

    <tr>
        <td>The contact page has this nice text transition effect where when you go onto the page, the text appears (This is a consideration)</td>
        <td>In the app version, it does not look good, it doesn’t fit right with the capabilities of the website (meaning, not a great conversion between the app and the website)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>I like how each arrow takes you to one of the other pages on the dropdown, this is probably something I won’t be doing but if I feel my designs could do with a bit more animation, I may well consider it.</td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>For an interactive feature, it has a small ‘destroy the webpage’ this is a cool little interactive game element that works well to show you his skills right off the bat. This might be something to consider.	</td>
    </tr>
</table>

Looking at all the aspects of what each page can offer as well as what I would like to take from them both, I have tried to outline my plans as clearly as possible here.
<ol class="planforwebsitelist">
	<li>I want a splash of colour, I think Matt Farley did a great showcase of this where he used mainly purple and white but had some green to add some contrast, this is something I think il investigate.</ul>
	<li>I liked the slightly minimalist approach that Seb and Matt had gone for, it wasn’t too overly minimal as Dejan Markovic’s website and I think I want to incorporate that element into my own design</ul>
	<li>I liked how Seb Kay’s website had the navigation bar and especially how well it fit with the App version, as well as the website, I want to ensure that it is integrated into an app design too, I want to ensure that my navigation bar will be horizontally visible and not through a dropdown menu</ul>
	<li>I liked how Matt Farley had his projects and pieces put together in a collage and this is something that I will be using.</ul>
    <li>One aspect of my research I found that I thoroughly enjoyed was what Seb had done, he had used his website not only as a portfolio but also as a blog to update about his own life.</ul>
    <li>I think one thing I want to play around with and potentially make is a 3D Cartoon look-alike of myself. This is something that may take me out of my comfort zone and teach me something new about 3d animation.</ul>
</ol>
I think there are more features id like to add in but for now, these are some of the basics that I have identified that I will be working on.
The first points where my research aspects that was primarily in Week one and two, this was both some research into portfolios as well as any my colour and font choices for this project
I decided to do some experimenting with coolor so that I could get an idea for a rough colour palette I would want to use, as well as this, going off on one of the components that Matt Key used, I want to utilise the colour wheel to go for opposing colours, this is so that I can have something to brighten up the page.
Using the image I found below, I know I want to use a primary colour and a complementary colour to do so. I chose to go for blue and orange, this wont be the exact colours that I use but I do intend to go for this style. Instead of a white or black background, I will be utilizing Gray as the core colour, with blue as a primary accent colour and orange to compliment it.

although this was a good base line for my content, In the end, I ended up using a dark blue and bright orange colour, using rgb’s;
<ul>
    <li>rgb(54, 50, 117)</li>
    <li>rgb(211, 100, 59)</li>
</ul>
along with white and black (in the files, I did not pick out RGB colours as it was just easier and more convenient to use these pre-built settings offered to me by visual studios).
At some point, I got extremely carried away with my research and decision making that instead of trying to keep thing simple to ensure that I would get my website done with the best aspects possible, I decided to create a mini-project (this was placeholder and I did not make this myself, I used a YouTube tutorial for this) and then I attempted to pair this with a tkinter edition so that I could see how it would look if I was designing a website for a company or a brand so that I got some more experience in how to link content to a website. Overall, it works (to a degree) which is a bonus. However, I would attempt it again and try to give more content especially because I could have added better content for some of the other area’s I stated in my projects page.
Moving into the fonts aspect, I did not necessarily care to implement a thousand fonts, I just needed a good font that would do the job and for this I went to google fonts and found the Poppins font, this was similar to Aptos and Arial but felt different in the sense of it had slightly more definition to it than they did, so with that, I decided to use this font throughout the entirety of my work.
Looking back of my planning phases, I realise that there was a lot that I left up to fate and this has been something I wanted to get better at but I do not feel as if it has been a massive downfall with this project.    
<div class="weektoweek">
    in Week one, this is where we we're taught about HTML and other aspects that would be crucial for the project's development, this week aside from all of my planning and preparation, i had created the HTML files that I would be working through, this would include;
    <ul>
        <li>the Homepage</li>
        <li>The Project Page</li>
        <li>The Contact Page</li>
        <li>The About Page</li>
        <li>the video demonstration page</li>
        <li>along with the page you are reading now</li>
    </ul>
along with these pages, i implemented some of the basic tags that I had been taught so that I could actually see a put together version of the pages so far.

In Week two, we got taught CSS and all the tags that followed, using my new knowledge of these tags, i decided to start putting some elements into the pages to bring some life into them, whether this being the colour aspects or borders, margins and padding, this allowed me to structure the page a little bit better.
this was the week, where grid layouts we're taught to us which led into a slight issue later on down the line where I had to rush around to implement this as I knew it would be needed for the grades that I am aiming for, there we're certain elements that I had actually implemented to ensure
that my base layout was something i felt proud to be able to work with, this being realistically in the form of just colors and text aspects and if memory serves right, i think on each page i had the navigation banners installed.

in week three, this is where I made a mistake, i hadnt made use of the entirity of week two and did not make a grid structure (i had gone back and done this but it is worth me stating my mistake) overall, this was a minor setback when compared to what I ended up doing, overall, there was nothing specific i did for the website
in week three other than tidy ups but one thing i had began to do was build the contact page, this was later revisited in week 5 so that i could make the website feature more content and especially content that was more specific to what I was doing.
this was the week where we also began to work around with GitHub and how branches and other aspects would work, i would like to say that in my own personal opinion, i still do not understand this very well but i still tried to implement this as much as possible
none the less as it was crucial for the marks and the grade that I am aiming for, i feel that maybe i should have spent more time experimenting with this as from speaking with peers and anybody that may have had experience using GITHUB or Git, that it
would actually be more beneficial to experiment with more so that I could actually utilise this service again. in terms of actually making content and other aspects, i dont believe I had done much in terms of page production and was more primarily focusing on
the pages that I currently had, ensuring that they we're all consistent (for desktop) and then when going into week four, I was able to move straight into mobile optimazation as quickly as possible.

in week four, this is where we learned about mobile optimazation, as this was actually a key part in the mark scheme to secure the grade that I was after, I would say that this became a sole focus so that I could ensure i was striving towards the grade boundary i wanted,
looking at what I actually did, i had reengineered my css files completely, where before i was just using a 'style' file as i will call it, we was taught a better approach would be to have mulitple (in my case just 3) CSS files so that it would make consistency
a higher priority, the files i created being;
<ul>
    <li>Main - this controls near enough every aspect across both the pages and for the most part, every element i have made, from the form on the contact page to the clickable links for my code on the projects page</li>
    <li>Desktop - this file featured little to no changes as nearly everything with elements was done in the main, however, for certain elements, i did need to do size configuration or even eliminate (certain elements
        this being the hamburger icon namely just so that way i could have it on one page and not the other)</li>
    <li>Mobile - this is very similar to the desktop where there is little changes where elements are concerned (aside from sizing and other aspects) but just standard file size configurations to make sure it was all consistent</li>
</ul>

In weeks five and six, i just began to put all of my content into the pages and ensure that it was to a good standard where i felt as if i could say it was complete or had little to no changes required afterwards,
during this time, i believe i had made the homepage, the about page as well as the projects page, there was times where i would leave the pages alone to work on the other and then come back to them. i plan to break down each page shortly
to explain what i did and perhaps even why.

overall, i would say that this entire project has been a learning curb into learning a new skill and testing my abilities and thinking, i feel like there are some aspects i would gladly retry as i feel i could definetely push myself next time and ensure that it is all up to a great standard but i can say that I am happy with how This
website has turned out.
<div class="feedbackoverall">
<div class="homepagefeedback">
starting off with the homepage, i am not overall satisfied with what there is on this page, it features little to no elements that i felt would elevate the page properly and i felt like utilising placeholders would be effective but i had no ideas on how
i would go about this, sadly, this is not something I am overall proud of in terms of my content but interms of my code, i feel that it is consistent with the rest of page, i would go back over and keep the welcome message primarily just on the homepage but
i feel that this is something i would rather have just reflected on instead of changing now as it does give other pages an additional element where needed.
<div class="projectpagefeedback">
the project page is something i put less time on in a short sense but is something that i can say i am proud of, i utilised placeholders here for majority of the concepts, the reason for this being is that shortly, i could not locate the relevant content for each section so
i felt it would be best to include something (using placeholders was the best alternative and would have allowed me to focus on other aspects so that i could aim for the grade i was after). something that i felt worked well here was content i used, this had allowed
me to section the content and make it look presentable and consistent as possible, on the mobile page, i would aim to try and make it a gallery effect but i felt that for the sake of consistency, i would implement other aspects,
these being animations, when you hover over each of the placeholders or even the link images, it changes opacity, this is something that would breathe more life into my website.
IT IS IMPERITIVE I NOTE TO YOU, for some of the coding projects that I DO NOT TAKE CREDIT FOR MAKING, i did use ChatGPT to help me build a TKINTER VARIATION, I did not make the tkinter for this myself, this was for the binary converter, for the Calculator, I used a youtube video
both of these have been noted in my Harvard referencing section.
<div class="aboutpagefeedback">
the about page is not my fondest pages, i let lose and spent way too much time putting in my life story, i should have kept it short and sweet at maybe about 500 words, as this could have been time better spent on another key page.
along with that, i feel like it is consistent across both pages to an extent but primarily on the desktop, it has this issue where when i used some of the html tags to make the text bold or italic or some aspect, even when i added images in
it would change the line and put my content on a seperate line to the one i wanted, as this page is not realistically needed, my concerns with this are little, just a personal issue i have with it where i'd like it to be a certain way but sadly is not.
<div class="contactpagefeedback">
this was my first page that i had worked on, it offers little to no amazing aspects, it is a contact page that serves as a way for visitors on my website and how they'd be able to contact me, one issue i will state is that I attempted to try and implement
the html form action and methods to try and add some functionality, this had not seemed to work but i wanted to try it anyways, i might look to add this in using javascript at a later date, if i intend to use this website in the future,
another aspect of the contact page i feel that i would like to make note of is that, i would have wanted to do more design elements but due to time management and not really knowing how to go about this, i felt it would be best to leave this for a future project.
<div class="feedback">
overall, i would say that I am happy with what I have produced, i do feel that i let myself get carried away with certain aspects and i could have tried to make sure that my content was more pristine and have more content available.
i would say that overall though, i am happy with how this is looking and that I can say i am proud to hand this in.

in terms of certain aspects, i feel that improvements can be made, for example, the close part for the hamburger icon menu, it feels disproportionate to what I was actually trying to make (an X) but I can live with this on my conscience.
another thing that I need to point out is that, i felt due to the lack of content, i felt it was not neccessary for me to make a drop-down menu, this is something i may regret later on due to lacking the experience of knowing how to do it,
but i felt that it would be better on my page as just what I have got present.
